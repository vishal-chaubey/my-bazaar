# Yaro-ki-dukan
Yaro-ki-dukan is a web based application intended for online retailers. It would make viewing, updating, deleting and selection of a product easier for users specific to their needs. The user can also create their account here. The application also provides an adding feature so that the users can add list of products to the shopping cart and user can also remove products from their cart. They can make their transactions through credit card (I have used stripe.com for easy credit card transaction which is a third party service). Users can also go through what they have purchased.
